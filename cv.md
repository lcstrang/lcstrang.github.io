### RECENT PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE
Teaching has been a long-term interest of mine. A good teacher can mean the difference between a lifelong passion for or enduring hatred of a subject. In my six years of teaching experience, I have learnt to balance the needs of students with diverse needs and to adapt my classes to suit the target audience.

* Sole tutor for second-year special relativity (~ 100 students)
* Maintained > 80% tutorial attendance throughout semester (average attendance across physics < 50%)
* Marked exams and assignments
* Provided out-of-class support to students
* Managed transition to remote learning in 2020 and overhauled in 2021 to maximize student engagement

**Work Experience Coordinator** at the [University of Melbourne](www.unimelb.edu.au) (2019)

* Developed and coordinated week-long intensive course for 20 highschool students
* Introduced new programme allowing students to use remote telescopes
* Organized team of volunteers to deliver content and meet legal obligations

**Tutor** for [PHYC10003](https://handbook.unimelb.edu.au/subjects/phyc10003), [PHYC10005](https://handbook.unimelb.edu.au/2019/subjects/phyc10005) & [PHYC10006](https://handbook.unimelb.edu.au/2021/subjects/phyc10006) at the [University of Melbourne](www.unimelb.edu.au) (2017 - 2020)

* Ran interactive tutorials with 15 -- 40 first-year students
* Identified gaps in study pathway for students with no prior physics experience
* Doubled number of students progressing from entry level physics to standard stream

**Consultant** at [Protiviti](www.protiviti.com.au) (2016 - 2017)

* Collaborated with clients across public and private industries
* Primary technical lead on IT projects including database management, IT security audit, and fraud identification
* Delivered workshops to increase the technical ability of the Protiviti team
* Assisted on project health assessments for major Australian businesses and public departments

### LEADERSHIP & COMMUNITY
I believe our community is at its best when it is inclusive and diverse. The most effective way I can give back to the physics community is to support physicists who face different challenges and use my outreach skills to promote the field to the public.

**[OzGrav](www.ozgrav.com.au) Equity & Diversity Committee** (2017 - PRESENT)
* Developed and presented hands-on microaggressions workshop at the 2019 OzGrav retreat for (N) academics and students
* Recommended the OzGrav headquarters should have an Acknowledgement of Country, leading to the committee commissioning a local artist to design an appropriate mural
* Advised on maximizing the accessibility of remote and in-person conferences prior to hosting the 2021 Amaldi conference

**Organizing the "Women in Physics & Maths" Retreat** (2015 - PRESENT)

* Co-coordinated the annual retreat for women and diverse genders in physics and maths
* Developed and delivered workshop on dealing with workplace aggression
* Panel member for discussion on industry employment
