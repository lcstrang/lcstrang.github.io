In [Strang & Melatos (2019)](2021-07-14-StrangMelatos19), we developed a simple model for a millisecond magnetar central engine to drive X-ray afterglows from short gamma-ray bursts (sGRBs) based on early models of young supernova remnants. 
In this work, we use the afterglows of six sGRBs to infer the properties of the source neutron star.

## Abstract
Time-resolved spectra of six short gamma-ray bursts (sGRBs), measured by the {\em Swift} telescope, are used to estimate the parameters of a plerion-like model of the X-ray afterglow. The unshrouded, optically thin component of the afterglow is modelled as emanating from an expanding bubble of relativistic, shock-accelerated electrons fuelled by a central object. The electrons are injected with a power-law distribution and cool mainly by synchrotron losses. We compute posteriors for model parameters describing the central engine (e.g. spin frequency at birth, magnetic field strength) and shock acceleration (e.g. power-law index, minimum injection energy). It is found that the central engine is compatible with a millisecond magnetar, and the shock physics is compatible with what occurs in Galactic supernova remnants, assuming standard magnetic field models for the magnetar wind. Separately, we allow the magnetic field to vary arbitrarily and infer that it is roughly constant and lower in magnitude than the wind-borne extension of the inferred magnetar field. This may be due to the expansion history of the bubble, or the magnetization of the circumstellar environment of the sGRB progenitor. 

## Overview

<!-- sGRBs are extremely bright, transient sources of light which last only a couple of seconds in the gamma-ray spectrum.  -->
<!-- Many sGRBs display an extended afterglow at longer wavelengths.  -->
<!-- In the case of X-rays, the afterglow sometimes takes the shape of a `plateau' (Fig. 1). -->
<!-- A typical X-ray plateau has three components: an initial decline, a plateau phase lasting from 10 s to $$10^5$$ s, and a final decline.  -->
<!-- The last two phases are shown in Figure 1. for GRB130603B. -->
<!-- The source of the plateau is widely debated in the community for several years, but no consensus has yet been reached. -->



<!-- ##### The physics -->

<!-- One popular class of models proposes that the prolonged emission in the X-ray band is evidence of ongoing energy injection from a central engine.  -->
<!-- The most likely culprit is a millisecond magnetar: a highly magnetized, rapidly rotating neutron star. -->
<!-- In this scenario, the rotational energy of the star is extracted via magnetic dipole braking and becomes the observed X-ray emission.  -->
<!-- At a high level, this is similar to early models of young pulsar wind nebulae, in particular the Crab nebula (Fig. 2.1). -->
<!-- This work explores the possibility that the mechanism driving X-ray production following sGRBs may be similar to that driving X-ray production in pulsar wind nebulae. -->

<!-- What, then, is the physics? -->
<!-- We assume that the merger leaves behind a rapidly rotating neutron star, which brakes electromagnetically as it emits a magnetized leptonic wind. -->
<!-- As the pulsar spins down, its rotational energy is converted into a mixture of mechanical and electromagnetic energy flux. -->
<!-- The interaction of the wind with the surrounding environment launches a reverse shock back into the wind, creating a 'bubble' of electrons just behind the shock.  -->
<!-- In the full [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.02877), we explore the evolution of the electron distribution function *N(E,t)* under the effects of synchrotron radiation, adiabatic expansion, and the injection of new electrons as the reverse shock propagates into the wind.  -->
<!-- We solve the partial differential equation governing the system and use *N(E,t)* to infer the synchrotron luminosity and spectrum as a function of time. -->

<!-- The goal of this work is to see if this simple model summarized above can produce light-curves similar to those observed following sGRBs. -->
<!-- The answer, as seen in Figure 3.1, is yes.  -->
<!-- The black crosses are observations of GRB130603B taken by the Neils Gehrels <a href="https://www.swift.ac.uk/xrt_curves/"><i>Swift</i></a> telescope, identical to Figure 1.1. -->
<!-- The blue curve is a sample light curve produced by our model. -->
<!-- Crucially, the blue curve is not a best-fit curve, but simply a sample curve produced using hand-chosen millisecond magnetar parameters.  -->
<!-- This is as much as we could reasonably expect from this simple model, but in the full [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.02877) we manage to reproduce additional observational features in the light curves. -->
<!-- In [Strang et al (2021)](SMSL21), we go a step further, using the spectra of six sGRBs to infer the parameters of the central engine driving the emission.  -->



<!-- ##### Take-home message -->

<!-- If a millisecond magnetar survives the sGRB, the relativistic outflow can be modelled using a simple model similar to early models of young supernova remnants.  -->
<!-- However, a more mature model is needed to see if this idea is competitive with established afterglow models in the field.  -->
