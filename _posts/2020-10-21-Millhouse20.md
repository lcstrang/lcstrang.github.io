LIGO observations from 2016 -- 2017 (Observing Run 2, or O2) are publically available for all astronomers. A team of researchers at the University of Melbourne use specialized signal processing techniques to search the data for continuous waves, an as-yet-undiscovered form of gravitational waves.

## Abstract
Persistent gravitational waves from rapidly rotating neutron stars, such as those found in some young supernova remnants, may fall in the sensitivity band of the Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (aLIGO). Searches for these signals are computationally challenging, as the frequency and frequency derivative are unknown and evolve rapidly due to the youth of the source. A hidden Markov model (HMM), combined with a maximum-likelihood matched filter, tracks rapid frequency evolution semicoherently in a computationally efficient manner. We present the results of an HMM search targeting 12 young supernova remnants in data from Advanced LIGOâ€™s second observing run. Six targets produce candidates that are above the search threshold and survive predefined data quality vetoes. However, follow-up analyses of these candidates show that they are all consistent with instrumental noise artifacts.
